# Certification Board Registries
:::note
- Please use **Registry** values for `certification_board`, and `alt_certification_board` in [**Request Body**](./create-employees.md#request-body) of [**Check Matches**](./create-employees.md) endpoint.
- Please refer to the **Required Fields** and **Required Fields** values for each **Registry** for the input logic.
- Other `certification_board` and `alt_certification_board` registries are independent, but most are dependent to other fields such as `certification_number`, `certification_state`, `date_of_birth`, `social_security_num`.
- The `certification_board` is in higher priority than `alt_certification_board`.
